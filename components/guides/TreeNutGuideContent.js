Although only about 40% of children with tree nut allergies have a peanut allergy, there's a significant chance of cross-reactivity among different tree nuts, with around 50% of children allergic to one tree nut also being allergic to another. Unlike some allergies that can be outgrown, tree nut allergies often persist throughout life.Â "
